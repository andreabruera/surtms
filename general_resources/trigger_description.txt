Trigger Description for EEG

e	h	c	w	= 6[0-8]	
e	l	c	w	= 8[0-8]
f	a	c	w	= 11[0-8]
f	c	c	w	= 13[0-8]
e	h	c	n	= 16[0-8]
e	l	c	n	= 18[0-8]
f	a	c	n	= 21[0-8]
f	c	c	n	= 23[0-8]


e = experimental
f = filler

h = high cloze
l = low cloze

a,c = cloze rating for filler

c = congruent

w = word 
n = non-word


Last Digit (= 0-8) indicates position in sentence

0 = Onset of Wav File 

2 = Onset of Sound (Stimulus begins with silence)

5 = Onset of Verb (+ triggers TMS pulse, pulse 1)

1 = TMS pulse (pulse 2 and 3)

6 = Onset of Article

8 = Onset of Noun (word or pseudoword; critical word)



Examples

85 	= Condition: experimental / low expectancy / congruent gender / words - Position: Onset of the Verb (+ triggers a TMS pulse)

68	= Condition: experimental / high expectancy / congruent gender/ words - Position: Onset of Noun. 


Subject Balancing

Left/Right Response: counterbalanced

Odd subjects --> Left = Word / Right = Pseudoword
Even subject --> Left = Pseudoword / Right = Word

Gender: Random
